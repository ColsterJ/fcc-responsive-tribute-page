# Tribute Page (FreeCodeCamp exercise/project)
* My original CodePen is located at https://codepen.io/coljonesdev/pen/YOXNPo.
* For some reason, the formatting looks slightly different as a CodePen vs. a standalone site on my iPhone, so my CSS rules in this repo are slightly different than in the Pen.

## Features:
* Fulfills the requirements of the FreeCodeCamp project description
* Responsive design that respects landscape vs portrait orientation and looks pretty good on both computers and phones - uses CSS media queries to achieve this
* YouTube embeds that resize responsively
* Google fonts
* Hopefully decent color design for someone without an art background
