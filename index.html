      <p><strong>Keigo Oyamada</strong>, best known by his stage name <strong>Cornelius</strong>, is a Japanese rock/electronic recording artist, multi-instrumentalist and singer. His musical career began to take off in the late eighties when he co-founded <strong>Flipper's Guitar</strong>, an influential band in Japan's <strong>Shibuya-kei</strong> scene with a sound heavily influenced by British pop and pop-punk bands of the 1980s.</p>
      <p>He began his solo career in 1991, upon the dissolution of Flipper's Guitar, and adopted a more experimental and electronic sound. He is often compared to Beck and has indicated that he is heavily influenced by him, as well as the Beach Boys, the Jesus and Mary Chain and other groups. He remains active to this day.</p>
